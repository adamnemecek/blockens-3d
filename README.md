I learned about vertex and matrix math from several books and online resources but mostly from [3D Math Primer for Graphics and Game Development](https://www.amazon.com/Math-Primer-Graphics-Game-Development-ebook/dp/B008KZU548/)

## This project features:

 * Keyboard controls for controlling the 3D cube.
 * An orthographic projection
 * Translation, rotation transforms and model-view rendering. 
 * I learned about wind order and culling and how the order of vertices dictate which side of a shape is the front.
 * Stencil depth, and various other 3D related aspects.

## Controls:
* Rotation: W, A, S, D, F, B
* Zoom: + -
* Translation: Up, Down, Left, Right, O, I
* Manipulate the far point with [ and ]
* Manipulate the near point with < and >
